      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>Imagine a town like a big rocky playground, but with some parts covered in green like parks and gardens. Some
        of these green spots are like neat gardens, so you won't find tasty plants there. But if you're a little
        explorer looking for yummy things to eat like berries or nuts, try to find places where nature is left alone,
        especially away from where lots of people live. Be extra careful when foraging near busy roads or factories
        because there might be icky stuff around. And stay away from places where people spray things to stop plants
        from growing.</p>
