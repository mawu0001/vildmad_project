        <p class="p_description">Juniper is one of the few original Scandinavian coniferous trees and it's played a
          culinary role since at
          least the Viking age, when it was used in making mead. It's still used to flavor alcohol—especially gin—but
          can do a lot more than just that.</p>

            Juniper thrives on heaths and similarly sandy areas where it resists the elements to grow in patches of
            green
            shrubbery or as small, erect trees. It doesn't need much in the way of nutrients, but juniper does require
            good light, so look for it in wide-open spaces with ample sunshine, and where the wind has free reign.

          <p class="p_how">
            Juniper is an evergreen bush or small tree with very pointy, bluish-green needles that grow in threes in a
            ring around its branches. The trees can grow up to four or five meters tall and sometimes have several
            trunks
            that grow closely together. Depending on how they're shaped by the elements, the trunks may be more
            horizontal
            than vertical. The bark is thick, reddish-brown, and on older trees it tends to flake off in large,
            elongated
            pieces. Dark blue berries are distributed throughout the branches. In May and June juniper blooms with green
            or yellow flowers.</p>

          <p class="p_bold">How to pick it</p>
          <p class="p_basket">
            Juniper berries are actually small, meaty cones that have ripened on the branches over the course of several
            years. The green berries that grow side-by-side with the blue, ripe ones are also cones—they just haven’t
            ripened yet. Because ripe and unripe berries, intermingle promiscuously with flowers on the same branch,
            you’ll need to pick by hand.</p>
